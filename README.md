📊 Student Score Prediction Based on Study Hours
This project aims to predict student exam scores based on the number of hours they spend studying. Various regression models are applied in this project to analyze the data and identify the most effective model for predicting student scores.

🛠️ Machine Learning Models Used
In this project, three machine learning models are employed to predict student scores based on study hours:

Linear Regression: A statistical model that attempts to establish a linear relationship between the number of study hours and student exam scores.
Decision Tree Regressor: A model that splits the data into subsets based on the features, using decision rules to predict the target variable.
Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.

📊 Results and Insights
The best-performing model based on evaluation is the [mention the best model, e.g., "Random Forest Regressor"], with an R² score of [mention the R² value]. This model provided the most accurate predictions for student scores based on study hours.
The analysis revealed a positive relationship between study hours and exam scores, meaning that the more hours spent studying, the higher the chances of achieving a higher score.
Important insights also showed that some students who studied fewer hours had unexpected results (outliers), which could be an area for further exploration.

Open and run the project:

Open the file Assignment_template_DSF.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook.
Run each code cell to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), train the models, and evaluate them.
